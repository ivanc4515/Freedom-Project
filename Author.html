          <p> Hi, I'm Ivan or the person who made this website. I had a couple of ideas for this project but I ended up on 3D printing. My Freedom project has gone through many changes and redesigns. I spent a lot of time working on this project and I'm proud of the outcome. Despite taking a long time to make and not being able to implement everything I want to, I think it still turned out great. I had a great time creating this website and appreciated the feedback I got from my peers to get my website to what it is now.  </p>
