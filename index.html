      <h2> About </h2>
        <div class="panel">
          <p id="column">3D modeling is the creating of the object digitaly. It sets a blue print or raod map for the printer. 3D printing is the where a machine makes you digitial model into real life. It prints using materials, usuilly plastic, by adding layer on top of one another to create a 3D object. To 3D print a object you need to create or donload a model on a modiling software. When your model is complet you can send it to the printer. There it will process the information and start to print. Printing an object can take a while bepending on the matireal used.  </p>

        <h2> Uses </h2>
        <div class="panel">
          <p id="column"> 3D printing is usually cheaper and easier to make everyday objects or even uncommon ones. For example 3D printers can be used for medical pouroposes by make body parts if a person needs one. It can even make prosthetic legs or arms. We can even build houses using a large scale 3D printer. This alternitive way is not only cheaper but faster than if people where to build it. </p>

        <h2> History </h2>
        <div class="panel">
          <p id="column"> The first computer model was created by Ivan Sutherland. He createdthe sketchpad, a machine that allowed for modeles to be created. This original disign would only be able to create 2D models. The 3D printer was created on 1984 by Charles Hull. This machine will shoot a UV lazer bean at photopolymer to harden it into plastic. </p>
